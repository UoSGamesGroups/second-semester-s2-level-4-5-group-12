Various spinners and devices to aim your water jets at. 

1: Vertical spinner
A cross shaped spinner that pivots around the middle. If hit in the middle it's less likely
it will actually spin. Causing it to spin gives a steady stream of points.

2: Horizontal spinner
A disk shaped spinner that pivots at the top and bottom, it will spin as long as it is hit. 
Like the veritcal spinner it gives a steady steam of points though slightly less as it is easier
to use.

3: Water 'scoop'
A small, quarter circle shaped  bucket that fills with water. Once full, it drops releasing any
water collecting and giving a medium quantity of points.

4: Large tank
A large tank that can be filled up with water by hitting the funnel on its top. It takes a lot
of water to fill, and gives a large amount of points when filled. When full, the bottom drops out
and it releases all the water into the middle drain, filling both players tanks.

5: Water Grill
A tank of water embedded into the wall, this tank is covered by a grill with thin openings. While
it gives a massive quantity of points, it takes a long time to fill, and releases all water
directly into the tank of water it is attached to.

6: Leaking bucket
Similar to the water scoop, however this bucket is ruptured and will gradually leak water. Thus, it
requires being filled quickly or the players effort will be lost. It gives a good amount of points.

7: Folding Target
A target on a stick, when hit it folds back, giving a small amount of points. It only requires
a tiny amount of water to trigger it. An example for the target could be a rubber duck.
