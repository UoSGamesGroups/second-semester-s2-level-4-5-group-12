Week One Meeting

Members present-All

Summary of first meeting:
Presentation was somewhat unclear on which idea we had chosen. Chris suggested looking into soft body
physics for the water.It was also suggested that we should have opened with some of the rejected ideas.


First Meeting
Decided we would use a pixilated art style.Research is clearly needed into different ways to simulate
water and water physics.


Tasks:

Elliot:
Research into different methods of simulating water physics, including soft body. Time: 2 Hours
Protoype a basic version of the game using Rigid body physics, perhaps also testing expanding colliders to avoid water being scattered upon launch? Time: 4 hours

River:
Setup a basic file structure for github, Assets, art, ect. Also setup the sprint for Jira. Time: 1 hour
Come up with ideas for spinners/wall items for use in game. Time: 1 hour
Find possible sound assets for anything usable in game. Time: 3 hours
Research anything else that could be relevant. Time: 1 hour

Joe:
Research into pixel art, find a style that could fit the game. Time: 2 hours
Researcg themes for the game, find a theme (eg, carnival, industrial ect) that would fit the game well. Time:2 hours
Research colour schemes for the game, find a mood that would work and get a colour pallette together. Time: 2 hours

Douglas:
Create placeholder assets for prototyping the game with. Time: 2 hours
Shift minuites into folder. Time: N/A
Come up with ideas for spinners/wall items for use in game. Time: 1 hour
Finalize/come up with new ideas for power ups. Time: 1 hour
Find possible sound assets for anything usable in game. Time: 1 hour
Research anything else that could be relevant. Time: 1 hour
